# System Architecture Diagram for LightNVR

This text file describes the system architecture diagram that should be created for the LightNVR documentation.

## Diagram Layout

The diagram should be a layered architecture diagram with the following components:

### Top Layer: User Interface
- Web Browser Interface
- Mobile App Interface (future)
- API Clients

### Second Layer: Web Server & API
- HTTP/HTTPS Server
- REST API Endpoints
- Authentication & Authorization
- WebSocket for Live Updates

### Third Layer: Core Components
- Stream Manager
- Recording Manager
- Storage Manager
- Database Manager
- Configuration Manager
- Event System

### Fourth Layer: Video Processing
- Stream Receivers (RTSP/ONVIF)
- Video Decoders (H.264/H.265)
- Frame Processors
- HLS Writer
- MP4 Writer

### Bottom Layer: System Resources
- File System
- Network Stack
- Hardware Acceleration
- Memory Management
- Thread Management

## Component Relationships

The diagram should show the following key relationships:

1. User interfaces connect to the Web Server & API layer
2. API layer interacts with Core Components
3. Core Components coordinate with each other
4. Stream Manager controls Video Processing components
5. All components interact with System Resources

## Visual Style

- Use a clean, modern style with clear boxes for each component
- Use different colors for each layer
- Show data flow with directional arrows
- Include a legend explaining the components
- Use icons where appropriate (camera for streams, disk for storage, etc.)

## Key Features to Highlight

- Memory optimization features
- Thread model
- Stream prioritization
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Modular design

This diagram will help users understand the overall architecture of LightNVR and how the different components interact with each other.
