/*
 * MP4 Recording Module
 * 
 * This file is a wrapper that includes the split implementation files:
 * - mp4_recording_core.c: Core functionality including initialization, cleanup, and the main recording thread
 * - mp4_recording_buffer.c: Frame buffer management for pre-buffering
 * - mp4_recording_writer.c: MP4 writer registration and management
 * 
 * The functionality has been split into separate files for better maintainability.

// The implementation is now split across multiple files:
// - mp4_recording_core.c
// - mp4_recording_buffer.c
// - mp4_recording_writer.c
