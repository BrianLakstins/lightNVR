# Progress: LightNVR (Initialization)

## Current Status

- **Overall:** Project appears functional based on README and documentation. Core NVR features (streaming, recording, web UI) seem to be implemented. Memory optimization is a key design principle.
- **Memory Bank:** Just initialized. Provides a baseline understanding but needs refinement as work progresses.

## What Works (Based on Documentation)

- Core application lifecycle (startup, shutdown).
- Configuration loading (`lightnvr.conf`, database).
- Stream management (RTSP/ONVIF connection).
- Video decoding/processing via FFmpeg.
- Recording to MP4/HLS formats.
- Storage management (basic retention likely exists).
- SQLite database for configuration and metadata.
- Web server (Mongoose) serving a UI and API.
- Frontend UI (Preact/Tailwind) for basic management (streams, recordings, settings).
- Basic user authentication.
- Optional SOD integration for detection.
- Docker build and deployment.

## What Needs Building / Refinement (Assumptions)

- **Detailed Feature Verification:** Need to confirm the exact implementation status and robustness of each documented feature through code review and testing.
- **Memory Usage Validation:** Verify actual memory consumption on target hardware against goals.
- **SOD Integration Details:** Understand the specifics of SOD model usage (RealNet vs. CNN) and configuration.
- **Error Handling/Recovery:** Assess the completeness and effectiveness of error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- **Security Hardening:** Review security aspects beyond basic authentication.
- **Advanced Features:** Features mentioned as future enhancements (plugins, clustering, hardware acceleration) are not implemented.

## Known Issues / TODOs (From Initial Scan)

- *None identified yet during Memory Bank initialization. Requires deeper code review.*
- The architecture diagram `docs/images/arch-shutdown.svg` mentioned in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` seems to be missing from the file list.

## Next Milestones

- Complete initial Memory Bank setup.
- Perform a more detailed code review of a specific subsystem based on the next task.
- Address any immediate issues identified (like the missing diagram).
