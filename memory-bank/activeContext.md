# Active Context: LightNVR (Initialization)

## Current Focus

- Initializing the Memory Bank documentation system.
- Establishing baseline understanding of the project structure, goals, and technology.

## Recent Changes

- Created core Memory Bank files:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md` (this file)
    - `progress.md`

## Next Steps

- Review the newly created Memory Bank files for completeness and accuracy based on initial project analysis.
- Begin addressing specific development tasks or user requests based on project priorities.
- Populate `progress.md` with the current state of the project (what's implemented vs. what's planned).

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The Memory Bank structure is now established. Future work will involve maintaining and updating these files.
- Initial context is derived from `README.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Further exploration of the codebase (`src/`, `include/`, `web/`) will be needed for specific tasks.
